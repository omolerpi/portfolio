                        I can count the number of times I have used an online food delivery service to assist with food delivery in the nearly three decades that I have lived. Well, perhaps I was not always too busy to go out and get food by myself, or I just preferred homemade meals.
                        <br><br> Nevertheless, the rate at which people all over the world utilize these food delivery companies has increased rapidly over the years. Research says that every week, delivery or takeout is ordered by 60% of consumers in the U.S., and 31% of them use third-party delivery services at least twice a week.
                        <br><br> In this project, I will be pretending to be a data analyst hired by DoorDash and have been challenged to:

                        The company has a goal to enhance its marketing efforts and is interested in identifying individuals who have made a purchase after being exposed to a marketing campaign. As a data analyst, that is where I come in. Ride with me!

                        I imported the data into Excel, cleaned, filtered, and sorted it to get rid of irrelevant information. After that, I did some basic statistical analysis using the functions count, countif, sum, max, min, and average to determine the data aggregation.

                        <li><p>Who is the most recently acquired customer?</p></li>
                        <li><p>Which months had a higher number of new customers?</p></li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>…to mention a few.</p><br><br>

                    <p>
                        I also need to mention that advertising campaign #6 is successful with the audience it was aimed for. The average monthly expenditure for clients who purchased after campaign #6 is 64% greater than the spending of the typical customer, with sales jumping from $562.76 to $924.41. This represents a growth in sales of 133.3%.

                        I plotted some graphs to better show the relationships between variables.

                    <p>
                        A scatter plot was made to show how much money DoorDash customers made and how much they spent all together. Customers with more money tend to spend more on the platform, which is shown by a positive trend in the graph. But there were a few things that didn’t fit this pattern. <br>
                        <br>The regression line was also positive, indicating that income and spending are linked. The R-squared score was 0.6774, indicating how strongly the two variables are connected. This high R-squared figure indicates that there is a strong linear link between DoorDash customers’ earnings and spending. The difference in income explains 67.75% of the variance in spending.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To further my analysis, I plotted a histogram to group customers’ spending into different brackets. This will allow us to identify and target high-spending customers more effectively.
                    </p><br><br>

                    <div class="article-img">

                    <p>
                        Furthermore, I developed a pivot table in order to examine the months in which new members joined the group.
                    </p><br><br>
                    
                    <div class="article-img">

                    <p>
                        Surprisingly, my analysis revealed an unconventional finding that the elderly age group of 66+ spent the most, despite being a smaller segment compared to the 36–50 and 51–65 age groups, which had higher total spending due to their larger number of consumers.
                    </p><br><br>

                    <div class="article-img">
                        <img src="/assets/project-pictures/Spending per age group.png" alt="Spending per age group">
                        <figcaption>Spending per age group</figcaption>
                    </div><br>

                    <p>
                        This implies that there are untapped opportunities for targeting the elderly demographic, where even a few consumers in this age group can outspend the other age groups by almost $100. It is a compelling insight that challenges the conventional wisdom of targeting the larger, younger demographic and opens up new possibilities for businesses to explore.
